<h1>Checkers</h1>
<p>We recreated checkers in Java using arrays and other tools.</p>

<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>When ran, the program prompts the user with a box for input. The blue player must go first and input the row of the checker they want to select. After confirming their number, the user recieves another box in which they will input the row number (this method is similar to battleship). This process is then repeated for the location the user wants to place said checker.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The program makes use of multiple methods and classes to create the board, pieces, locations, and rules of the game. By combining all of these, it makes the game of checkers.</p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>This project *attempted* the use of the Graphics utility as well as JFrame. This is present when first running the program as a graphical board appears. Due to our limited knowledge, we were unable to discover how to properly utilize said tools. The game is instead played through the system using different numbers as different elements.</p>
